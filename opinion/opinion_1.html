<h1 style="font-size:300%;"> Some notes on Jared Diamond's Anna Karenina Principle </h1>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Why we should not trust all that we see </h1>

<p align="justify", style="font-size:150%; margin: 10px 200px;"><TT> Yes. This is another attempt at criticising that impregnable castle that is Guns, Germs and Steel. The internet is full of reviews, summaries and, of course, those classy threads in Reddit. He has been widely prized, but also criticised in almost all fronts; history, human evolution, geography, and in many cases he seems to have been badly wounded, like in that review of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4006551">Michael Barratt Brown</a>, or the Mises Institute <a href="https://mises.org/mises-daily/diamond-fallacy"> critical review</a> on what they call Diamond’s pseudo-history. But when it comes to biology, he still stands tall and proud, like the Sphinx at Giza.<TT></p>

<p align="justify", style="font-size:150%; margin: 10px 200px;">That is why I am still to find a proper critique of Diamond’s chapter on animal domestication. The more I read about the subject, whereas horses or aurochs, the more I find that there seems to be two camps: one completely ignores Diamond, as if avoiding the wrath of a Demigod; the other one cites his books and articles as priests citing Saint Matthew. </p> 

<p align="justify", style="font-size:150%; margin: 10px 200px;">I am not a biologist, which kind of gives me the outsider’s advantage. It also puts me on a blind spot, as most non-specialists can easily get lost in the detail and interpret things in a completely mistaken way. I get that. But not being a biologist also allows me to approach the subject with an unorthodox point of view. I am irresolutely at peace with the prospect of being wrong about animal domestication. Probably Diamond has been right all along and that is why no one challenges his theory of animal domestication. </p>

<p align="justify", style="font-size:150%; margin: 10px 200px;"> 
Diamond’s thesis about animal domestication is poured in chapter 9 Zebras, Unhappy Marriages, and the Anna Karenina Principle. But before I start talking about the subject proper, I need to say something about the literary analogy. The “Anna Karenina principle” has been used in all sort of situations and it wasn’t invented by Diamond. He may have made it widely popular outside the fenced pastures of literary criticism and other disciplines such as psychology and economics, but it’s definitely not his. I say this because people seem to attribute to Diamond all sort of ideas, when in reality what he has done, very well, is to summarise a huge variety of different ideas and to create a synthesis of what he thinks is the evolution of mankind. Another very popular myth is that he invented the continental axis hypothesis. The first person to mention it was Alfred Crosby in Ecological Imperialism. Crosby did not elaborate a full hypothesis though, and only mentioned the possibility of the north-south axis of the Americas to be one of many reasons for the slow pace of development:
</p>

<p align="justify", style="font-size:140%; margin: 20px 270px;"> <TT> 
“Why was the New World so tardily civilized? Perhaps because the long axis of the Americas runs north and south, and so the Amerindian food plants on which all New World civilizations depended had to spread through sharply dif­fering climates, unlike the staple crops of the Old World, which by and large spread east and west through regions of roughly similar climates.” (p. 18) <TT>
